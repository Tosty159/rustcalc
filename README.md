# RustCalc
A Rust-based command-line calculator

## How to use

1. Clone the repository or downloas the source code.

2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.

3. Run the project using Cargo:
    ```bash
    cargo run
    ```

4. Once the program is running, input an expression as long as it follows the following rules:
### Supported syntax:
- Decimal numbers.
- Binary operators: '+', '-', '*', '/', '^'
- Unary operators: '+', '-'
- Brackets: '()'
### Notes:
- Make sure all open brackets are properly closed.
- The program doesn't allow you to input improper syntax, so don't worry about having to delete invalid operators/symbols :p
